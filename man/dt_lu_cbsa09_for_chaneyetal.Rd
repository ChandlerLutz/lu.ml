\title{Highly Disaggregated Land Unavailability Data for U.S. CBSAs}
\format{
A \code{data.table} with observations for U.S. CBSAs, containing 56 variables:
\describe{
\item{msacode}{Character. The Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA/CBSA) code. Acts as the key.}
\item{id}{Character. A unique identifier for each MSA, consistent with the Chaney et al. (2012) data.}

\item{slope_unavailable_cbsa_...\emph{pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{CBSA} unavailable due to steep slopes, calculated with different percentage buffers (e.g., \code{000} for 0\%, \code{005} for 0.5\%, \code{010} for 1.0\%, \code{015} for 1.5\%, \code{020} for 2.0\%).}
\item{water_unavailable_cbsa}...\emph{pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{CBSA} unavailable due to water bodies, with various percentage buffers.}
\item{wetlands_unavailable_cbsa}..._pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{CBSA} unavailable due to wetlands, with various percentage buffers.}

\item{slope_unavailable_prin_city_...\emph{pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{principal city} unavailable due to steep slopes, with different percentage buffers (from \code{000} to \code{150}, representing 0\% to 15.0\%).}
\item{water_unavailable_prin_city}...\emph{pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{principal city} unavailable due to water bodies, with various percentage buffers.}
\item{wetlands_unavailable_prin_city}..._pct_buffer}{Numeric. Percentage of land in the \strong{principal city} unavailable due to wetlands, with various percentage buffers.}

\item{slope_unavailable_prin_city_circle_radius_...km}{Numeric. Percentage of land unavailable due to steep slopes within a circular area around the \strong{principal city's} center, with different radii (from \verb{20km} to \verb{100km}).}
\item{water_unavailable_prin_city_circle_radius_...km}{Numeric. Percentage of land unavailable due to water bodies within a circular area around the \strong{principal city's} center, with various radii.}
\item{wetlands_unavailable_prin_city_circle_radius_...km}{Numeric. Percentage of land unavailable due to wetlands within a circular area around the \strong{principal city's} center, with various radii.}

\description{
This dataset provides measures of land unavailability for U.S. Core-Based
Statistical Areas (CBSAs) based on the 2009 delineations. The data quantifies
the percentage of land that is unavailable for development due to physical
constraints such as steep slopes, water bodies, and wetlands. Measures are
provided for both the entire CBSA and the principal city within it, using
various buffer and radius specifications.

The data is formatted to be easily merged with the Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar (2012)
dataset, hence the name \code{..._for_chaneyetal}.
